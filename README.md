### Attendance Logger - Tool to log students' participation in meetings.

In our team, each student is required to participate a minimum number of hours of meetings
during the build season in order to participate in competitions. This app is intended for mobile
attendance tracking for an Android tablet or phone while away from the meeting place. Each student, 
when walking in, will select their names on the check-in list and click the check-in button. When 
leaving, they will select their names in the check-out list and click the check-out button. This 
allows us to keep track of the minutes they have attended meetings. The program keeps track of this
info in an Excel spreadsheet which can sum up the total hours of each student if needed.
